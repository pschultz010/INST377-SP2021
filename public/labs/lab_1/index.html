    <h1>Pete Schultz's Internet Page</h1>

First, the basics.

    <h2>Heading 1</h2>

Headings set your default page size

Add your four mochi images from your tutorial here. 

    <h2>Lists</h2>

Let's make an unordered list.

<ul>element 1</ul>
<ul>element 2</ul>
<ul>element 3</ul>

And now, one in order.

<ol>Album 1</ol>
<ol>Album 2</ol>
<ol>Album 3</ol>
<ol>Album 4</ol>
<ol>Check it out, numbers by default.</ol>

    <h2>Inline elements</h2>
<p>
    Sometimes you want to <i>draw attention</i> to something in a line of text.
</p>
<p>
    Sometimes you want to <b>strongly emphasize</b> something in the text.
</p>
<p>
    <b>
        <i>Sometimes you want to do both.</i>
    </b>
</p>


    <h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything. Neither can image tags, or hard lines.

Add a hard line under here.

This page probably doesn't look great - we'll learn how to hook it to CSS next week.
